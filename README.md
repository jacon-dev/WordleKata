# Wordle Kata Inc.
Hello engineer, welcome to Wordle Kata Inc.

As you're probably aware, some online game called "_Wordle_" recently skyrocketed in popularity
and has taken the world by storm!

As a company we're looking to get on board the hype train and get our own version out the door for
people to play, without the silly limits of one word a day!

However, our last developer started to write the application and then decided to leave for a coffee 
and didn't come back, so we need you to finish their work!

## Requirements
 - Random word generated should be no more than 5 letters long
 - Guessing the word should compare all the letters to check for:
   - correct letters in the correct place should be marked as "O"
   - correct letters in the wrong place should be marked as "?"
   - wrong letters should be marked as "!"
 - You should only get five attempts at guessing the word
 - When you complete the game you should be able to restart it

## Nice To Have
 - Statistic tracking while playing:
   - Total games played
   - Total words guessed correctly
   - Total words guessed incorrectly
   - Average attempts per game
